### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on remaking [MyNextJob](mynextjob.ro)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning every advanced feature of my tech stack
- ðŸ™ƒ I like emacs more than vim
- âš¡ Fun fact: with every 30 days that you are living you get .1% closer to being put in a coffin and being burried

# ðŸ“¦ I've decided to archive(you can still browse them though) any repo before 2020, because with only 2 years of experience under my belt, the code was not that great

#### My software development journey
- Learned Java and Android SDK in 2017, this whole year was spent on learning
- Stopped being a lazy bastard in 2017
- Released my first app on the Play Store in 2018
- Learned Flutter in 2019
- Landed my first freelance project in 2020
- Learned Node.js, AWS, Express.js, Mongodb Linux in 2020 because of client needs(Hi David)
- Learned html, css, js in 2021
- Learned Typescript, React.js, Next.js, React Native, Monorepos, E2E testing, Webmin, Tailwind because of client needs(Hi Mihai), in 2022
- Learned basic data structures in 2022
